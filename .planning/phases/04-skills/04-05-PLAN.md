<objective>
End-to-end verification of Phase 4 Skills system - human testing of skill discovery, invocation, auto-selection, and creation flow.

Purpose: Verify all Phase 4 success criteria via real user interaction before marking phase complete.
Output: Verified skills system or list of issues to fix.

  <what-built>Complete Phase 4 Skills system: discovery, Telegram integration, CLI picker, proactive suggestions</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
## Pre-Flight

1. Build and start gateway:
   ```bash
   npm run build && npm run gateway
   ```
2. Note: skill-creator should auto-install (check logs)

## Test 1: Skill Discovery & Commands

1. In Telegram, type `/` to see command menu
2. Verify `/skill` and `/skills` commands appear
3. Send `/skills` - should list skill-creator
4. Send `/help` - should mention skill commands

**Expected:** skill-creator listed, commands visible in menu

## Test 2: CLI Skills Manager

1. In another terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run build && node dist/index.js skills
   ```
2. Select "View installed skills" - should show skill-creator
3. Select "Install curated skill" - should show summarize option
4. Install summarize skill
5. View installed skills again - should show both

**Expected:** Interactive picker works, skills install to ~/.klausbot/skills/

## Test 3: Skill Invocation

1. Send `/summarize This is a long text that needs summarizing. It contains multiple points and ideas.`
2. Claude should use the summarize skill instructions

**Expected:** Response follows summarize skill format (if skill has specific output format)

## Test 4: /skill Command

1. Send `/skill skill-creator`
2. Claude should enter skill creation mode, asking what skill to create

**Expected:** skill-creator activates and guides through skill creation

## Test 5: Auto-Selection (Optional)

1. Send "Can you summarize this article?" with some text
2. Claude may auto-select summarize skill based on system prompt context

**Expected:** Claude may mention using the skill, or use it transparently

## Test 6: Proactive Suggestion (Difficult to test quickly)

This requires repeated similar requests. Skip if time-constrained.
The system prompt includes instructions; Claude should suggest after 3+ similar tasks.

## Results

Document any issues:
- [ ] Test 1 passed
- [ ] Test 2 passed
- [ ] Test 3 passed
- [ ] Test 4 passed
- [ ] Test 5 passed/skipped
- [ ] Test 6 skipped (requires multi-day testing)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all critical tests pass, or describe issues found</resume-signal>

<verification>
All Phase 4 success criteria verified through human testing:
1. User requests task, Claude selects appropriate skill - TEST 3/5
2. Pre-installed skills work out of the box - TEST 4
3. Claude suggests skill creation after repeated patterns - TEST 6 (system prompt verified)
4. User approves skill creation, skill persists - TEST 4 flow
5. Skills use standard SKILL.md format - Structural verification
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Critical tests (1-4) pass
- No blocking issues discovered
- Phase 4 requirements (SKILL-01 through SKILL-05) satisfied
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-skills/04-05-SUMMARY.md`
