<objective>
Create learning system: LEARNINGS.md file, system prompt instructions for consultation and proactive suggestions.

Purpose: Enable bot to learn from mistakes and suggest improvements.
Output: Complete learning and suggestion system via system prompt.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add LEARNINGS.md template and bootstrap</name>
  <files>src/memory/identity.ts, src/bootstrap/prompts.ts</files>
  <action>
Update src/memory/identity.ts:
1. Add DEFAULT_LEARNINGS constant after existing DEFAULT_* constants:

```typescript
/** Default LEARNINGS.md content */
export const DEFAULT_LEARNINGS = `# Learnings

Record mistakes, insights, and lessons learned here.
Newest entries first. Remove entries that are no longer relevant.

## Format

Each entry:
\`\`\`
## YYYY-MM-DD: Brief title
What happened and what to do differently next time.
\`\`\`

(No entries yet - learnings will be added as we work together)
`;
```

2. Export DEFAULT_LEARNINGS

Update src/bootstrap/prompts.ts:
1. Import DEFAULT_LEARNINGS from '../memory/identity.js'
2. In BOOTSTRAP_INSTRUCTIONS, after identity file creation instructions, add:

```
5. Create identity/LEARNINGS.md with initial template:
   - This file tracks mistakes and insights for future reference
   - Start with the default template explaining the format
```

3. Modify the section that lists files to create/write to include LEARNINGS.md
  </action>
  <verify>
npm run build
grep -n "DEFAULT_LEARNINGS" src/memory/identity.ts
grep -n "LEARNINGS.md" src/bootstrap/prompts.ts
  </verify>
  <done>
LEARNINGS.md template exists. Bootstrap flow creates the file.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add learning and proactive instructions to system prompt</name>
  <files>src/memory/context.ts</files>
  <action>
Update src/memory/context.ts getRetrievalInstructions():

1. Add LEARNINGS.md to Available Files section:
   - identity/LEARNINGS.md - Mistakes and insights from past sessions

2. Add new section before "## NEVER Expose Internal Details":

```
## Learning from Past Mistakes

When handling tasks that might have gone wrong before:
1. Read identity/LEARNINGS.md to check for relevant past mistakes
2. Apply learnings to avoid repeating errors
3. If you make a new mistake or learn something valuable, add it to LEARNINGS.md

### LEARNINGS.md Format

Each entry is a simple lesson learned:

\`\`\`
## YYYY-MM-DD: Brief title
What happened and what to do differently next time.
\`\`\`

Entries are chronological, newest first. Remove entries that are no longer relevant.

## Proactive Improvement Suggestions

After completing a task, consider whether you noticed:
- Patterns that could be automated (cron jobs)
- Repeated tasks that could become skills
- Workflow improvements based on user behavior

If you have a useful suggestion:
1. Complete the primary task first
2. At the end, offer the suggestion naturally
3. Let the user decide whether to act on it

Example: "By the way, I noticed you often check the weather in the morning. Would you like me to set up a daily weather update?"

Don't suggest if nothing relevant. Not every conversation needs suggestions.
```

3. Update "## NEVER Expose Internal Details" to include LEARNINGS.md in the list of files not to mention.
  </action>
  <verify>
npm run build
grep -n "LEARNINGS.md" src/memory/context.ts
grep -n "Proactive Improvement" src/memory/context.ts
  </verify>
  <done>
System prompt includes learning consultation and proactive suggestion instructions.
Internal details section includes LEARNINGS.md.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. npm run build succeeds
2. DEFAULT_LEARNINGS exported from identity.ts
3. Bootstrap instructions include LEARNINGS.md creation
4. System prompt contains:
   - LEARNINGS.md in available files
   - Learning consultation instructions
   - Proactive suggestion instructions
5. LEARNINGS.md in "never expose" list
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- LEARNINGS.md created during bootstrap (same as other identity files)
- Claude instructed to read LEARNINGS.md when relevant (agentic, not loaded at start)
- Claude instructed to suggest improvements at end of conversations
- Internal file details hidden from user
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-proactive/05-04-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
